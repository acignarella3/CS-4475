User Interface for Warping Code

This program allows you to place corresponding points in a “source” image (on the left)
and a “target” image (on the right).  When the warping code works properly, the target
image will be a warped version of the source.

You can place a new point by clicking the mouse in either the source or the target image.

You can move an already existing point by dragging it with the mouse.  You can drag
the points that are in either image.

You can delete a point by first selecting it with the mouse (it should turn blue),
and then pressing the “delete” key.

Additional Keyboard Commands:

x  toggle off/on drawing the points
s  save the warped image to the file “warped.png”
q  quit the program
